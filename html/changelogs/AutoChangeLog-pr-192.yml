changes: 
  - rscadd: "Bodies can now be manually cremated by setting them on fire while their limbs are fully damaged."
  - rscadd: "Cremation causes limbs to gradually burn off into ash; once none are left, the body is destroyed."
  - tweak: "Fire damage is now evenly distributed instead of applied to a random limb every tick."
